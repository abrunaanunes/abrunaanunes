### Hi there, I'm Bruna ðŸ‘‹

Software Developer with over four years of experience and a degree in Systems Analysis and Development from the Federal Technological University of ParanÃ¡. I have solid experience in the full software development lifecycle, from database design and modeling to the implementation and delivery of robust solutions.

Working at Grupo Mercado MÃ³veis, I am part of the innovation team, where I actively participate in the development of new features, performance improvements, system integrations, and customized solutions. I work with technologies such as PHP, Laravel, VueJS, and Docker, and I am committed to best development practices, including design patterns, SOLID principles, and agile methodologies.

I am always looking to enhance my skills and apply innovative solutions, ensuring maximum efficiency and quality in every project.
